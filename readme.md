# Neo LED

## Description
* A simple PCB for mounting SMD 1010 adafruit 4492 neopixels.
* 2 pin input, 5V DC and data line, 
* Should be drivable with V_{cc} from a pi pico, pro micro, etc.
* Simple grid pattern.
* Should evolve in future, expand to more LED, MCU on board, button cell clasp etc.

Here's the circuit diagram, things should be decently specced here, nothing but to test the real thing!

The current PCB design, this ones more of a work in progress : )
